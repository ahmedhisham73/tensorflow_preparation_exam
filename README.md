description for notebooks 

-Notebooks Named TensorFlow implemented for tensor flow basic operations as an introduction to using of TensorFlow, from computations to some basic Machine learning functions and operations 

-Simple Housing Problem Notebook describes a basic linear Model using on Dense layer to explore a relationship between housing prices to the number of the bedrooms per house , its intended to give you a simple introduction on using TensorFlow to estimate the house price based on the number of the available bedrooms 


-Fashion MNIST notebook using MLP , describes the usage of multi-layer preceptron in developping a simple neural network to solve one of the computervision challenges which is image classification problem 


-Fashion MNIST notebook with CallBacks , introduces the usage of callback function inside the training loop to control the training loop process hence controls the entire model training
